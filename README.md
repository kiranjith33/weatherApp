initiative
Follow these steps to activate the Weather App:

Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
Open the project directory in your text editor or IDE.
Replace the location text in the script.js file YOUR_API_KEY with your own OpenWeather API key. You can obtain an API key by registering on the OpenWeather website.
Save the changes to a script.js file.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Start searching for weather information by typing a location in the search bar and pressing Enter or clicking the "Search" button.
Using the API
The Weather App uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather information. The API provides weather information based on geographic information or place names.

To query the API, you need an API key, which can be obtained by registering on the OpenWeather website. Set your actual API key to the location text in the script.js file as YOUR_API_KEY.

API requests are made using the fetch() function in JavaScript. The response from the API is in JSON format, which is then parsed and displayed on the web page.
